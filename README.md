# TypeScript language-spec in html

> Because PDF and DocX are soo 2010

The official PDF and DocX are cumbersome to use, and it looks as if the team has [no interest in improving it](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/2143) with a more usable HTML version.

## How?

The HTML was generated by taking the [DocX from the repo](https://typescript.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest), then using Word to export 'filtered HTML', then with a mix of automation and pain the remaining mess was chopped into html blocks and with some [Grunt](http://www.gruntjjs.com) wrapped in pages. If you've ever exported HTML from Word you know this was a traumatic experience (seriously).
